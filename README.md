# DjangoTypesGen

Use your web-browser Luke!
Input a model class name and get related types for free :)

app.html is hosted there on my website:
<https://lyaudet.eu/laurent/DjangoTypesGen/app.html>
Since it is only static HTML and JS,
it should handle many users :).
Otherwise, you can just save the file on your computer,
and open it in your web-browser to use it.
