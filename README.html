<p>Use your web-browser Luke! Input a model class name and get related
types for free :)</p>
<p>app.html is hosted there on my website: <a
href="https://lyaudet.eu/laurent/DjangoTypesGen/app.html"
class="uri">https://lyaudet.eu/laurent/DjangoTypesGen/app.html</a> Since
it is only static HTML and JS, it should handle many users :).
Otherwise, you can just save the file on your computer, and open it in
your web-browser to use it.</p>
